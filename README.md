# introduction

single cell RNA seq is used in fundamental and translational research to identify cell populations within a biological sample, infer the connections and relationships between these populations and identify the effects of experimental conditions on the transcriptome of these populations. 
There are numerous pipelines and tools available to perform analysis of such data.  We will use the well established Bioconductor pipeline in R to perform full analysis of a human PBMC dataset starting from the raw count matrix.

# objectives

During the course, the students will learn to:

- understand and manipulate a SingleCellExperiment R object
- perform quality control and low quality cell exclusion
- normalize the data
- perform dimentionaly reduction
- cluster the cells and identify marker genes
- perform cell cycle and cell type annotation
- integrate multiple samples
- combine cells into pseudobulk and perform differential gene expression analysis with DEseq2
